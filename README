Using the script:
-This script is designed to be run on a Linux machine, it uses the wget command along with other Linux specific syntax.

-Start by changing directories to the location you want to store your website copy. Then create a folder for your website to be downloaded into. Once that folder is made change directories into it and copy your WebsiteMirror.sh script into it. Once the script is copied into that directory, just change directories to it and start the script. Keep in mind that in its present for that this script has to be modified to fit your needs before running it (see comments inside the .sh file to adjust it for your needs.). Once the script is set up it can be run over and over to capture the changes in a website.
